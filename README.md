## 💡 Example Use Case

If you enter the word **"CHEF"** and select **01-01-2025** as the start date, it will:

* Convert each letter into a pixel pattern (7 rows × 5 columns)
* Map each `#` in the pattern to a specific date (row = weekday, column = week)
* Display those dates as **colored blocks** and list them as **active days**
* Let you download this entire visualization as an image
